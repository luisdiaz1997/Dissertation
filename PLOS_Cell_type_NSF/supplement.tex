\section{Supplemental Methods}

% Goal: Motivate the biological need and computational challenges. Introduce your solution conceptually.
% Spatial Transcriptomics Overview
% ST links gene expression with spatial coordinates.

% Important for understanding tissue architecture, cellular interaction, and disease.

Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (ST) techniques enable the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial coordinates in tissue sections. This spatial information is crucial for understanding how gene activity varies across different tissue regions, how cells interact with their neighbors \cite{Verma2021-sj}, and how structure and function emerge in health and disease \cite{Moses2022-sw}. Such insights have been instrumental in the study of embryonic development \cite{Karaiskos2017-gf, Lohoff2022-ch, Hallou2025-sw}, tumor progression \cite{He2025-td, Zhang2024-wz}, and immune compartmentalization \cite{Kleshchevnikov2022-kw, Cable2022-cv}.

% \paragraph{Limitations of Existing Models.}
% --- Limitations of Existing Models ---
% PCA/FA/NMF: ignore spatial information.
% GP-based (e.g., MEFISTO, NSF): capture spatial structure but:
%     Often fail to distinguish spatial from cell-type patterns.
%     Lack nonnegativity → hard to interpret.
%     Do not account for known or inferred cell-type identities.

Dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) \cite{Bartholomew2011-vg}, and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) \cite{Lee1999-au} are commonly used to analyze high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data \cite{Sun2019-kj, Wolf2018-sz, Butler2018-ej}. These methods can also be applied to ST datasets, but disregard spatial information altogether.

More recently, spatially aware models such as MEFISTO \cite{Velten2022-ci}, SpatialPCA \cite{Shang2022-ju}, and Nonnegative Spatial Factorization (NSF) \cite{Townes2023-it} use Gaussian processes (GPs) \cite{Seeger2004-gw} or related kernel-based priors to capture smooth spatial variation. MEFISTO uses an explicit GP formulation, while SpatialPCA uses a multivariate normal prior with spatial kernel-defined covariance—functionally similar to a GP. While these models recover spatial structure, their dense real-valued factors can be difficult to interpret. NSF improves interpretability by enforcing nonnegativity via exponentiated GP priors, yielding sparse, parts-based decompositions \cite{Townes2023-it}. However, none of these models explicitly incorporate cell-type information, limiting their ability to distinguish between spatial patterns that are gene-specific versus those driven by cell-type localization.



% \paragraph{Disentangling Spatial and Cell-Type Signals.}

% --- Disentangling Spatial vs. Cell-type Patterns ---
% Critical to determine whether patterns arise from gene-specific spatial effects or cell-type-specific organization.
% Motivation: Embryonic development, tumor heterogeneity, immune compartmentalization.

Classical non-spatial methods use transcriptomic profiles to infer cell types through dimensionality reduction, entirely independent of spatial context \cite{Butler2018-ej, Wolf2018-sz}. In contrast, spatial decomposition models like NSF \cite{Townes2023-it} or MEFISTO \cite{Velten2022-ci}, recover spatial gene expression patterns across tissues, but these can still be confounded by structured variation in cell-type abundance—especially when cell-type labels are not modeled explicitly. Meanwhile, methods such as cell2location \cite{Kleshchevnikov2022-kw} and C-SIDE \cite{Cable2022-cv} focus on estimating cell-type compositions across spatial locations using reference single-cell data and spatial information. However, these approaches are designed to recover cell types, not spatially structured gene expression patterns.

It is therefore important to distinguish between these goals. A \emph{cell type} is defined at specific spatial locations (i.e., individual cells or regions), while a \emph{spatial gene expression pattern}, as recovered by factorization models \cite{Townes2023-it, Velten2022-ci, Shang2022-ju}, is a structured signal distributed across the tissue. Without explicit modeling and consideration of cell types, spatial gene expression patterns can be misinterpreted. Often, it is impossible to know when spatial changes in gene expression are a function of expression changes within a cell type across the sample or changes in cell type frequencies across the sample, and deconvolving the impact of both types of changes on gene expression in spatial samples is an important task.

Clarifying the contribution of each source is essential for understanding how spatial regulation and cellular identity shape tissue architecture. For example, during embryonic development, positional information precedes cell identity: gradients of morphogens guide gene expression, differentiation, and tissue patterning before distinct cell types have formed. Methods such as DistMap \cite{Karaiskos2017-gf}, Lohoff et al. \cite{Lohoff2022-ch}, and Hallou et al. \cite{Hallou2025-sw} use spatial references and probabilistic models to localize scRNA-seq cells in developing embryos. In tumor microenvironments, spatial organization reflects interactions between malignant and immune cells, often forming structured niches. Methods like Starfysh \cite{He2025-td}, stKeep \cite{Zuo2024-mj}, and SpaTopic \cite{Zhang2024-wz} have uncovered spatial domains using expression patterns and graph-based decompositions. Similarly, in lymphoid and inflamed tissues, immune cells localize to compartments like B-cell follicles or T-cell zones. cell2location \cite{Kleshchevnikov2022-kw} models these cell-type distributions by integrating reference cell types with spatial transcriptomic profiles.

Despite this progress, many current spatial analysis models conflate gene- and cell-type-driven signals, making it difficult to determine whether observed spatial patterns are due to gene regulation or to cell-type composition \cite{Townes2023-it, Cable2022-cv}. This is particularly problematic because most ST datasets lack ground-truth cell-type labels and rely on unsupervised clustering or label transfer from scRNA-seq data \cite{Cable2022-cv, Sun2019-kj}. As a result, factorized spatial components may reflect gradients in cell-type abundance rather than gene-specific spatial programs. Such signals may appear to reflect gene-specific regulation when they are in fact driven by the spatial distribution of cell types across the tissue. Conversely, they may be attributed to the presence of particular cell types when the underlying variation is due to spatially structured expression of individual genes or gene programs, independent of cell identity. In many cases, spatial patterns reflect a combination of both effects. Without models that jointly account for spatial position and cell-type structure, disentangling these sources of variation, and assigning biological meaning to them, remains a fundamental challenge.


% To resolve this ambiguity, models must explicitly incorporate both spatial information and cell-type identity—whether known or inferred—to separate spatial gene expression from cell-type localization. This distinction is especially important for studying developmental trajectories, immune zonation, and tumor ecology, where spatial patterning and cellular composition are intricately linked.

In this work, we introduce Multigroup Nonnegative Spatial Factorization (MNSF), a scalable and interpretable factorization method for spatial transcriptomics. MNSF integrates both spatial coordinates and known or inferred cell-type labels into a unified framework using Multigroup Gaussian Processes (MGGPs) \cite{Li2021-fv}. Unlike standard GPs, MGGPs enable the modeling of structured variation across multiple groups (e.g., cell types) while sharing statistical strength across the spatial domain.

Our method extends the NSF framework by replacing its GP prior with a multigroup GP prior over spatial factors~\cite{li2025bayesian}. This modification allows MNSF to model cell-type-specific spatial variation while preserving the interpretability and sparsity of nonnegative factorizations. We develop a variational inference framework for MGGPs, leveraging Cholesky-based whitening to improve numerical stability and scalability. This framework is general-purpose and can be applied to other spatial models such as SpatialPCA or any other latent variable GP model.

To ensure efficient optimization, we initialize the model with standard NMF and apply stochastic variational inference (SVI)
\cite{Blei2017-ed}, enabling application to large datasets with hundreds of thousands of spatial locations. % this isn't true anymore. also, this is methods, not introduction. I would move this last sentence to methods.
Furthermore, MNSF supports \emph{in silico} perturbation experiments and studies of cellular plasticity by allowing researchers to manipulate cell-type labels and observe the resulting predicted spatial transcriptomics patterns, providing a powerful direction for future hypothesis testing in spatial biology.
MNSF addresses key limitations of current spatial factorization methods by identifying spatial patterns in gene expression levels that are specific to cell type within a nonnegative, scalable, and interpretable probabilistic model. MNSF enables the disentanglement of gene- and cell-type-driven spatial patterns and offers a flexible framework that can be extended to a broad class of models for spatial transcriptomics.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Predictive posteriors reveal limitations of MGGP in cell-type perturbation}

We first applied MNSF with a full multigroup GP (MGGP) prior to the Slide-seqV2 hippocampus dataset, using 3,000 inducing points across 15 annotated cell types. This setup worked reasonably well for capturing broad spatial structure and produced decent factors over the entire tissue. However, when we tried simulating predictive posteriors conditioned on individual cell types (i.e., asking “what would this factor look like if all cells were of type CA1-CA2-CA3-subiculum?”), we observed that predictive posterior simulations conditioned on individual cell types often yielded spatially diffuse or nearly vanishing signals (Figure ?~\ref{fig:slideseq-pp}).


We think this happens because the posterior is only really supported by a small number of inducing points from the selected cell type — maybe around 200 out of 3,000 in our case. Even though the MGGP kernel allows for some sharing across groups, most of the information comes from the same group we’re conditioning on. So when that group only exists in a small region (like CA1-CA2-CA3-subiculum), the model just doesn’t have much signal to generalize beyond that region. The predictions get depleted very quickly.

\subsection{VNNGP improves local fidelity but uncovers region-specific factor sparsity}

To fix the resolution issues in the MGGP-based model, we switched to a variational nearest neighbor GP (VNNGP) formulation. In this setup, we only condition on a local subset (e.g., 50) of nearest inducing points, instead of all 3,000. This helped a lot with blurry posteriors — the cell-type-conditioned outputs were sharper and more localized in Slide-seqV2 (Figure~\ref{fig:slideseq-vnngp}).

When we condition on a cell type that is specific to a region,(e.g., subiculum) across the full hippocampus, the factor gets depleted outside that region. This makes sense — the model can’t really learn a spatial function over the full tissue if the training signal for that label is only in a narrow window, like tissue regions.

\subsection{Cell-type-conditioned predictions in MERFISH colon data reveal global enrichment and depletion patterns}

To evaluate MNSF in a setting where cell types are more spatially widespread, we applied the VNNGP-based MNSF model to the HuColonCa-FFPE MERFISH dataset, which consists of over one million spatially resolved cells across approximately 50 cell types. For scalability, we subsampled 100,000 cells while preserving cell-type diversity.

In this setting, cell-type-conditioned predictive posteriors recovered structured patterns of both enrichment and depletion across the tissue (Figure 4~\ref{fig4a}). This contrasts with the purely depleted signals observed in Slide-seqV2, suggesting that MNSF successfully captured global spatial variation attributable to individual cell types. The wider tissue distribution of cell types in colon tissue enables MNSF to learn more generalizable spatial functions, making posterior simulations more biologically meaningful.

\subsection{Shared factor initialization enables comparison of healthy and fibrotic liver tissue}

We next applied MNSF to spatial transcriptomics data from human liver, comparing healthy and fibrotic (diseased) conditions. The dataset comprised multiple samples per condition. To enable cross-sample comparisons of latent factors, we first trained MNSF on a pooled healthy dataset and used the learned factors and loadings to initialize per-sample models. This initialization strategy partially mitigates the inherent non-identifiability of nonnegative factorizations, allowing us to track comparable factors across biological replicates .

We then used this shared-initialization MNSF model to analyze fibrotic liver samples. Several spatial factors exhibit altered expression domains or shifted association with specific cell types in diseased tissue (Figure~\ref{fig8-liver-posteriors}). 

\subsection*{Cell-type perturbation reveals disease-specific shifts in spatial programs}

To explore how spatial patterns associated with specific cell types may shift under pathological conditions, we used MNSF’s cell-type-conditional posterior framework in both healthy and fibrotic liver samples. In particular, we aimed to investigate how the spatial programs of hepatocytes and endothelial cells—two major cell populations in liver tissue—might differ across health and disease.

By simulating predictive posteriors conditioned on individual cell types, MNSF provides a structured way to compare how spatial gene expression programs vary under different tissue contexts. This framework enables future hypothesis testing regarding spatial remodeling in disease, such as fibrosis-associated reorganization of vascular or epithelial compartments.

Multigroup Nonnegative Spatial Factorization (MNSF) expands NSF to incorporate both spatial and cell-type information through multigroup Gaussian processes (MGGPs)\cite{Li2021-fv}. The model takes as input: a spatial transcriptomics count matrix \( Y \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times J} \), spatial coordinates \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \), and group labels \( C = \{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_N\} \) (e.g., cell types or clusters).

The model is:
\begin{align*}
y_{ij} &\sim \text{Poisson}(\nu_i \lambda_{ij}) \\
\lambda_{ij} &= \sum_{l=1}^L w_{jl} \exp(f_{il}) \\
f_{il} &\sim \text{MGGP}\left(0, K_l\left((x_i, c_i), (X, C)\right)\right)
\end{align*}

Here, \( \nu_i \) is a per-spot normalization term, \( w_{jl} \) are gene loadings constrained to be nonnegative (via softplus transformation), and \( f_{il} \) are spatial latent factors with a multigroup Gaussian process prior. The covariance function is defined over both space and group label:

\begin{align*}
K\left((x, c), (x', c')\right) = \sigma^2 \left(\alpha^2 d_{cc'}^2 + 1\right)^{-D/2} \exp\left( -\frac{\beta^2 \|x - x'\|^2}{\alpha^2 d_{cc'}^2 + 1} \right)
\end{align*}

where \( d_{cc'} \) is a group-level distance (e.g., discrete or hierarchical), and \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \sigma \) are kernel hyperparameters. This formulation enables smooth signal sharing across related cell types while allowing for structured differences in spatial expression patterns.

\subsection*{ Hybrid Spatial–Nonspatial Model for Denoising}

To improve robustness, we extend MNSF into a hybrid model that captures both spatial and nonspatial structure. In this formulation, each latent dimension is split into a spatial component \( f_{il} \) and a nonspatial component \( h_{il} \), yielding:

\begin{align*}
y_{ij} &\sim \text{Poisson}(\nu_i \lambda_{ij}) \\
\lambda_{ij} &= \sum_{l=1}^L w_{jl} \exp(f_{il}) + \sum_{l=1}^L v_{jl} \exp(h_{il}) \\
f_{il} &\sim \text{MGGP}\left(0, K_l\left((x_i, c_i), (X, C)\right)\right) \\
h_{il} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, s_l^2)
\end{align*}

The gene loadings \( w_{jl} \) and \( v_{jl} \) are nonnegative and control the contribution of spatial and nonspatial latent factors, respectively. The spatial factors \( f_{il} \) capture coherent gene expression structure that varies over space and group, while the \( h_{il} \) terms absorb residual variation that is not spatially structured. This decomposition acts as a denoising mechanism, preventing the model from fitting noise or local artifacts as spatial signal. Spatial factors tend to converge to smooth patterns capturing dominant tissue-scale variation (see Fig.~1).

The model is initialized using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which accelerates convergence and stabilizes training. Variational inference with sparse inducing points is used for scalability, and softplus transformations are applied to all constrained parameters to improve numerical stability.


\subsection*{Cell-type Conditional Posterior Experiments}

To understand the extent to which spatial patterns in MNSF are influenced by cell-type labels, we conducted a series of \textit{in silico} perturbation experiments. Specifically, we modified the cell-type labels \( C \) used as inputs to the multigroup Gaussian process kernel and recomputed the posterior predictive distribution of the spatial factors \( F \) under the new labels. This enables us to measure the conditional dependence of each spatial factor on the cell-type context.

At training time, the posterior predictive distribution is given by:
\[
q(F \mid X, C_X) = \int p(F \mid U, X, C_X, Z, C_Z) \, q(U) \, dU,
\]
where \( q(U) \) is the variational distribution over inducing variables, and \( F \sim q(F \mid X, C_X) \) is sampled to construct the Poisson rate used in the likelihood.

During the \textit{in silico} perturbation experiments, we keep the spatial coordinates \( X \) fixed but modify the label inputs \( C_X \) to a new configuration \( C_X^{\text{new}} \). We then sample from the recomputed posterior:
\[
F^{\text{new}} \sim q(F \mid X, C_X^{\text{new}}),
\]
allowing us to observe how predicted spatial factors change under altered label assignments.

For each spatial factor \( f_l \), we selected a fixed spatial coordinate \( x_i \) and replaced its original cell-type label \( c_i \) with a different label \( c_i' \), while keeping all other inputs unchanged. We then recomputed the predictive posterior \( q(f_{il} \mid x_i, c_i') \) using the variational inference framework described in Supplemental Section~\ref{sec4}. If the spatial factor \( f_l \) exhibits strong cell-type specificity, its posterior mean or variance should change significantly under this perturbation.

We performed these experiments across multiple datasets and visualized the resulting spatial patterns after setting all cell-type labels to a single target type. This yielded a controlled view of how spatial factors behave when conditioned on different cell-type contexts. In MERFISH FFPE Colon (Figure \ref{fig4a}), we observed several factors whose intensity patterns were strongly modulated by the input label, suggesting that those factors encode cell-type-specific spatial structure. In contrast, other factors remained largely unchanged, indicating they capture spatial programs shared across cell types.

These conditional posterior analyses reveal that MNSF can disentangle spatial variation that is tightly coupled to cellular identity from variation that is broadly shared. By manipulating cell-type labels independently of spatial coordinates, MNSF supports a novel form of exploratory analysis that is not available in standard GP-based spatial models. This framework provides a promising foundation for future work in virtual perturbation, tissue engineering simulations, and hypothesis generation regarding spatial gene regulation.



\subsection*{ Variational Nearest Neighbor Model}

To improve scalability while maintaining the ability to model cell-type-specific spatial variation, we replace the full multigroup Gaussian process (MGGP) prior with a variational nearest neighbor Gaussian process (VNNGP) prior. This formulation significantly reduces computational overhead by conditioning each latent function value \( f_{il} \) on a small set of neighboring inducing points.

The MNSF model under the VNNGP approximation is defined as:
\begin{align*}
y_{ij} &\sim \text{Poisson}(\nu_i \lambda_{ij}) \\
\lambda_{ij} &= \sum_{l=1}^L w_{jl} \exp(f_{il}) \\
f_{il} &\sim \text{VNNGP}\left(0, K_l\left((x_i, c_i), \{(z_k, c_k)\}_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)}\right)\right) 
\end{align*}

Here, \( \mathcal{N}(i) \) denotes the index set of the \( K \) nearest inducing points to \( (x_i, c_i) \) under a joint spatial and label-aware distance metric. Instead of conditioning on all inducing points as in standard MGGPs, each spatial factor \( f_{il} \) is now modeled as a GP conditioned only on a local subset of \( K \) points, yielding substantial savings in time and memory.

The VNNGP approximation reduces the computational complexity of inference from \( \mathcal{O}(LNM^2) \) to \( \mathcal{O}(LNK^2) \), where \( N \) is the number of spatial locations, \( M \) is the total number of inducing points, and \( K \ll M \) is the number of nearest neighbors used per observation. This makes the model well suited for large-scale spatial transcriptomics datasets, including those with hundreds of thousands of spots.

During variational inference, the inducing variables are shared across the entire tissue but grouped by label during neighbor selection, allowing both global sharing and local adaptation of spatial structure. Unlike in the regular variational MGGP case, we don't apply whitening transformations, but instead, we derived a KL-divergence approximation (see methods) of a multivariate normal variational inducing distribution to keep cell-to-cell relationships but also enforce a proper GP prior on the factors.

This nearest neighbor-based approximation enables MNSF to scale to large spatial transcriptomics datasets without compromising the model’s ability to recover cell-type-aware spatial factors.

One limitation of the cell-type conditional posterior experiments described in Section~2.3 is their reliance on a relatively small number of inducing points. For instance, using 5{,}000 inducing points to represent a dataset with over one million spatial locations introduces a resolution gap that limits the model’s ability to generalize across cell-type perturbations. In such regimes, full-posterior updates under perturbed cell-type labels may fail to capture localized structure, especially when the spatial resolution of inducing points is relative to the density of the data. The VNNGP framework helps address this limitation by conditioning each prediction on a local neighborhood of inducing points, improving spatial fidelity and robustness to label-specific variation in large-scale experiments.

\subsection*{Full KL Divergence for VNNGP}

We approximate the KL divergence between the variational distribution \( q(U) \) and the GP prior \( p(U) \) using a locally conditional chain rule factorization. Let \( U = [U_1, \dots, U_M] \) be the collection of inducing variables. The prior and variational distributions are factorized as:

\begin{align*}
p(U) &= p(U_1) \prod_{j=2}^{M} p(U_j | U_{1, \dots, j-1}) \approx \prod_{j=1}^{M} p(U_j | U_{n(j)}) \\
q(U) &= q(U_1) \prod_{j=2}^{M} q(U_j | U_{1, \dots, j-1}) \approx \prod_{j=1}^{M} q(U_j | U_{n(j)})
\end{align*}

This approximation allows us to express the KL divergence as a sum of local terms:


\begin{align*}
\mathrm{KL}(q(U) \| p(U)) 
&= \mathbb{E}_{q(U)} \left[ \log \frac{q(U)}{p(U)} \right] \\
&\approx \sum_{j=1}^{M} \mathbb{E}_{q(U)} \left[ \log \frac{q(U_j | U_{n(j)})}{p(U_j | U_{n(j)})} \right] \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{M} \mathbb{E}_{q(U_{n(j)})} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{q(U_j | U_{n(j)})} \left[ \log \frac{q(U_j | U_{n(j)})}{p(U_j | U_{n(j)})} \right] \right]\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{M} \mathbb{E}_{q(U_{n(j)})} \left[ \mathrm{KL}(q(U_j | U_{n(j)}) \| p(U_j | U_{n(j)})) \right]
\end{align*}


Each term in the sum compares the conditional posterior and prior distributions. These are Gaussian conditionals:

\begin{align*}
p(U_j | U_{n(j)}) &= \mathcal{N}\left( \beta_j^\top U_{n(j)}, \; \tau_j^2 \right) \\
q(U_j | U_{n(j)}) &= \mathcal{N}\left( m_j + \alpha_j^\top (U_{n(j)} - m_{n(j)}), \; \tilde{\tau}_j^2 \right)
\end{align*}

Where:

\begin{align*}
\beta_j^\top &= K_{jn(j)} K_{n(j)n(j)}^{-1}, \quad
\tau_j^2 = k_{jj} - K_{jn(j)} K_{n(j)n(j)}^{-1} K_{n(j)j} \\
\alpha_j^\top &= S_{jn(j)} S_{n(j)n(j)}^{-1}, \quad
\tilde{\tau}_j^2 = s_{jj} - S_{jn(j)} S_{n(j)n(j)}^{-1} S_{n(j)j}
\end{align*}

The KL divergence between two univariate Gaussians is:

\[
\mathrm{KL}(q \| p) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \log \frac{\tau_j^2}{\tilde{\tau}_j^2} 
+ \frac{\tilde{\tau}_j^2}{\tau_j^2} 
+ \frac{\mathbb{E}_{q(U_{n(j)})}\left[(\mu_q - \mu_p)^2\right]}{\tau_j^2} - 1 \right]
\]

To evaluate the expectation term \( \mathbb{E}_{q(U_{n(j)})}[(\mu_q - \mu_p)^2] \), we write:

\[
\mu_q - \mu_p = m_j + \alpha_j^\top (U_{n(j)} - m_{n(j)}) - \beta_j^\top U_{n(j)} 
= (\alpha_j - \beta_j)^\top U_{n(j)} + (m_j - \alpha_j^\top m_{n(j)})
\]

Then use the standard quadratic expectation identity for Gaussians:

\[
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)}[(a^\top x + b)^2] = a^\top \Sigma a + (a^\top \mu + b)^2
\]

Applying this gives:

\[
\mathbb{E}_{q(U_{n(j)})}[(\mu_q - \mu_p)^2] = 
(\alpha_j - \beta_j)^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} (\alpha_j - \beta_j) + 
\left[(\alpha_j - \beta_j)^\top m_{n(j)} + (m_j - \alpha_j^\top m_{n(j)})\right]^2
\]

This expectation can be expanded further and simplified as:

\[
= \alpha_j^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} \alpha_j + \beta_j^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} \beta_j - 2 \alpha_j^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} \beta_j + (\beta_j^\top m_{n(j)} - m_j)^2
\]

Substituting this into the KL formula yields the final approximation:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{KL}(q(U) \| p(U)) \approx \sum_{j=1}^{M} \frac{1}{2} \Bigg[
&\log \frac{\tau_j^2}{\tilde{\tau}_j^2}
+ \frac{\tilde{\tau}_j^2}{\tau_j^2}
+ \frac{(\beta_j^\top m_{n(j)} - m_j)^2}{\tau_j^2} \\
&+ \frac{\beta_j^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} \beta_j}{\tau_j^2}
+ \frac{\alpha_j^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} \alpha_j}{\tau_j^2}
- \frac{2 \alpha_j^\top S_{n(j)n(j)} \beta_j}{\tau_j^2}
- 1 \Bigg]
\end{align*}

This decomposition allows for scalable computation of the KL divergence in sparse MGGP models using only local neighbor subsets \( n(j) \). It is especially useful for variational nearest-neighbor Gaussian processes (VNNGPs), and can be efficiently computed in parallel across all nodes.
